## Project Description
...
Telecommunication companies (telecos) have a significant problem with customer churn, which is the loss of customers who stop using their services. To tackle this problem, telecos need to identify the customers who are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them. Machine learning models can help telecos in predicting the customers who are most likely to churn, based on various factors such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and payment history.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. To accomplish this, the project will involve the following steps:

1. Data collection: Collect data from various sources such as customer demographics, usage patterns, payment history, and other relevant factors that can impact customer churn. (dataset has been provided by Azubi team)
2. Data preprocessing: Perform various data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning, missing value imputation, feature engineering, and scaling to prepare the data for machine learning models.

3. Exploratory data analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of various features, identify outliers, and correlations between features.

4. Model selection: Select appropriate machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks for churn classification.

5. Model training and evaluation: Train the selected machine learning models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

6. Hyperparameter tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the best-performing model.
7. Deployment: Deploy the final model in a production environment and integrate it with the teleco's customer retention system.

The final deliverables of this project will be a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn and a report documenting the entire process of model development, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The report will also include recommendations on how the teleco can use the model to improve customer retention and reduce churn.
